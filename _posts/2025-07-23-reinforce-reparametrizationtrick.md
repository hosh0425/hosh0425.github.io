The famous quadratic formula is used to solve equations of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

It's a powerful tool taught in every algebra class. The formula itself is:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

The term inside the square root, $b^2-4ac$, is called the discriminant. It tells us the number of real solutions.
